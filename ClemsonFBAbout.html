    <h1> About the website! </h1>

    <p> Well hello there!  Welcome to what I (more about me later) hope to call ClemsonFB.com one day.  I
        created this website as a way to learn how to build a website from scratch.
        I didn't know what to make, but I am Clemson student and have been a Clemson fan all my life.  So,
        with that being said I just decided to make a website around.  I consider this to be similar
        to (and very much inspired by) TigerNet.com.  The major difference between the two is that
        ClemsonFB.com is run by just me so be patient becuase this is going to take time to complete, and
        of course it isn't going to be as robust as TigerNet.com because I am just doing this to learn
        new skills.  With all that being said enjoy the site and Go Tigers!
    </p>

    <h1> About me! </h1>

    <p>  Hi, again! Now you know why this website exists, but you know nothing about me!  So, my name
        Paige I am currently a Junior at Clemson University.  I am majoring in Computer Science (hence why I want
        to spend my free time learning how to make a website) with a minor in Business Administration.  I have been
        a Clemson fan my entire life.  I was saying that I was going to come to Clemson since I was 5, so that just
        shows how much I love it in God's contry.  I think that is all you really need to know about me, so please
        enjoy the website.
