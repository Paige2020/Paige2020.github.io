      <p> On January the 7th, the Clemson football team left their mark not only
          in the history of the Clemson football program, but also in the
          history of college football when they beat the Alabama Crimson Tide 44-16.
          They won the program's third national title and the second title in
          three years.  They made college football history by being the first
          team in modern history to be 15-0. </p>
